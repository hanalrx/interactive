	<p>Do Not Go Gentle Into 
	<br>That Good Night
	<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>Old age 
<br>should burn and rave 
<br>at close of day
<br>
<br>Rage
<br>rage against the dying of the light</p>

<br><br><br>

    <p>Though wise men 
    <br>at their end 
    <br>know dark is right
<br>Because their words
<br>had forked no lightning 
<br>they
<br>
<br>Do not go gentle 
<br>into that good night</p>

<br><br><br>

<p>Good men
<br>the last wave by
<br>crying how bright
<br>Their frail deeds 
<br>might have danced 
<br>in a green bay
<br>
<br>Rage
<br>rage against the dying of the light</p>

<br><br><br>

<p>Wild men 
<br>who caught and sang the sun in flight
<br>And learn
<br>too late
<br>they grieved it on its way
<br>
<br>Do not go gentle 
<br>into that good night</p>

<br><br><br>

<p>Grave men
<br>near death
<br>who see with blinding sight
<br>Blind eyes could blaze like meteors 
<br>and be gay
<br>
<br>Rage
<br>rage against the dying of the light</p>

<br><br><br>

<p>And you
<br>my father
<br>there on the sad height
<br>Curse
<br>bless me now with your fierce tears
<br>I pray
<br>
<br>Do not go gentle 
<br>into that good night
<br>
<br>Rage
<br>rage against the dying of the light</p>

<br><br><br>

<br>-Dylan Thomas
