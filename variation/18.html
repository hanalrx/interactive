Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night
<br><br>-Dylan Thomas-
</p>
<div align="center">0</div>
<p class="head2" align="center">
Do not go gentle into that good night
<br>Old age should burn and rave at close of day
<br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light
</p>

<p class="head2" align="center">
Though wise men at their end know dark is right
<br>Because their
 words had forked no lightning they
<br>Do not go gentle into that good night.

<p class="head3" align="center">
Good men
<br>the last wave by
<br>crying how bright
<br>Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay
<br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light
</p>

<p class="head3" align="center">
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight
<br>And learn
<br>too late
<br>they grieved it on its way
<br>Do not go gentle into that good night

<p class="head3" align="center">
Grave men
<br>near death
<br>who see with blinding sight
<br>Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay
<br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light
</p>

<p class="head4" align="center">
And you
<br>my father
<br>there on the sad height
<br>Curse
<br>bless me now with your fierce tears
<br>I pray
<br>Do not go gentle into that good night
<br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light
