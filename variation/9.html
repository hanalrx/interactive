<h6>Dylan Thomas</h6>
<h6>Do not go gentle into that good night</h6>
<br><br>
<h6><em>Do not go gentle into that good night</em></h6>
<h6>Old age should burn and rave at close of day</h6>
<h6><em>Rage, rage against the dying of the light</em></h6>
<br><br>
<h5>Though wise men at their end know dark is right</h5>
<h5><em>Because their words had forked no lightning they</em></h5>
<h5><strong>Do not go gentle into that good night</strong></h5>
<br><br>
<h4>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright</h4>
<h4><em>Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay</em></h4>
<h4><strong>Rage, rage against the dying of the light</strong></h4>
<br><br>
<h3>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight</h3>
<h3><em>And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way</em></h3>
<h3><strong>Do not go gentle into that good night</strong></h3>
<br><br>
<h2>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight</h2>
<h2><em>Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay</em></h2>
<h2><strong>Rage, rage against the dying of the light</strong></h2>
<br><br>
<h1>And you, my father, there on the sad height</h1>
<h1><em>Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray</em></h1>
<h1><strong><em>Do not go gentle into that good night</em></strong></h1>
<h1><strong>Rage, rage against the dying of the light</strong></h1>
