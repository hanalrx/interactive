<h1>Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night</h1>
<h4>Do not go gentle into that good night
<br>Old age should burn and rave at close of day
<br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light
<br>Though wise men at their end know dark is right
<br>Because their words had forked no lightning they
<br>Do not go gentle into that good night
<br>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
<br>Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay
<br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light
<br>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight
<br>And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way
<br>Do not go gentle into that good night
<br>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
<br>Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay
<br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light
<br>And you, my father, there on the sad height,
<br>Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
<br>Do not go gentle into that good night.
<br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light
</h4>
