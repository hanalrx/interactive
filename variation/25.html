<div>Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night
</div>
<br><br><br>
<div>Do not go gentle into that good night
</div>
<div>Old age should burn and rave at close of day
</div>
<div>Rage, rage against the dying of the light
</div>
<br>
<div>Though wise men at their end know dark is right
</div>
<div>Because their words had forked no lightning they
</div>
<div>Do not go gentle into that good night</div>
<br>
<div>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright</div>
<div>Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay</div>
<div>Rage, rage against the dying of the light</div>
<br>
<div>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight</div>
<div>And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way</div>
<div>Do not go gentle into that good night</div><br>
<div>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight</div>
<div>Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay</div>
<div>Rage, rage against the dying of the light</div><br>
<div>And you, my father, there on the sad height,</div>
<div>Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray.</div>
<div>Do not go gentle into that good night.</div>
<div>Rage, rage against the dying of the light</div><br>
<div>Dylan Thomas</div>
