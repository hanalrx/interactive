Do Not Walk Gentle Into That Good Night
</span>


<br>


<span class="first1">
Do not go gentle into that good night
</span>


<br>


<span class="first">
Old age should burn and rave at close of day
<br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light

</span>
<br>
<span class="second">
Though wise men at their end know dark is right
</span>
<br>
<span class="second2">
Because their words had forked no lightning they
</span>
<br>
<span class="second3">
Do not go gentle into that good night
</span>
<br>
<span class="third">
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
</span>
<br>
<span class="third2">
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay
</span>
<br>
<span class="third3">
Rage, rage against the dying of the light
</span>
<br>
<span class="forth">
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight
</span>
<br>
<span class="forth2">
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way
</span>
<br>
<span class="forth3">
Do not go gentle into that good night
</span>
<br>
<span class="fifth">
Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
</span>
<br>
<span class="fifth1">
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay
</span>
<br>
<span class="fifth2">
Rage, rage against the dying of the light
</span>
<br>
<span class="six">
	And you, my father, there on the sad height
</span>
<br>
<span class="six1">
	Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray
</span>
<br>
<span class="six2">
 Do not go gentle into that good night
 </span>
 <br>
 <span class="six3">
Rage, rage against the dying of the light
 </span>
 <br>
 <span class="last">
