Do not go gentle into that good night
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<hr>
<br><br>
Do not go gentle into that good night<br>
Old age should burn and rave at close of day<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light<br>
<br><br>
<hr>
<br><br>
Though wise men at their end know dark is right<br>
Because their words had forked no lightning they<br>
Do not go gentle into that good night<br>
<br><br>
<hr>
<br><br>
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br>
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light<br>
<br><br>
<hr>
<br><br>
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight<br>
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way<br>
Do not go gentle into that good night<br>
<br><br>
<hr>
<br><br>
Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br>
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light<br>
<br><br>
<hr>
<br><br>
And you, my father, there on the sad height<br>
Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray<br>
Do not go gentle into that good night<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light<br></p>
