<p>Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night</p>
<br>
<p>Do not go gentle into that good night
<br>Old age should burn and rave at close of day
<br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light</p>

<p>Though wise men at their end know dark is right
<br>Because their words had forked no lightning they
<br>Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>

<p>Good men
<br>the last wave by
<br>crying how bright
<br>Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay
<br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light</p>

<p>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight
<br>And learn
<br>too late
<br>they grieved it on its way
<br>Do not go gentle into that good night</p>

<p>Grave men
<br>near death
<br>who see with blinding sight
<br>Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay
<br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light</p>

<p>And you
<br>my father
<br>there on the sad height
<br>Curse
<br>bless me now with your fierce tears
<br>I pray
<br>Do not go gentle into that good night
<br>Rage, rage against the dying of the light</p>
<br>
<br>-Dylan Thomas
